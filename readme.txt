== Description ==

If you want your website protected from the access of one ore more browser/operating system, this is the plugin for you!

With Bluagent you can set filters on the consumers’ User agent. The filters containing one or more words, will not access your website, and they will be redirected on the page “stop.php”

Obviously you can change the page “stop.php” just replacing it!

For example:

If you want all Apple products not to access your website, you just have to add on Bluagent settings this string:

* mac,iphone,ipod,ipad,macintosh

Now your website will be accessible for everyone, except for Apple.

Of course you can do a lot of different things using Bluagent, you just need a bit of creativity!

What are you waiting for? Start enjoying it, it is free!
